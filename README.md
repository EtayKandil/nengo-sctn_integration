# nengo-sctn_integration
This repository explores a spiking continuous-time neuron (SCTN) integrated into Nengo (NEF). We implement a two-population harmonic oscillator and instrument the code with hardware offload hooks so that heavy compute steps can later be accelerated on FPGA (or emulated). The notebook demonstrates configuration, simulation, and basic analysis (time-series and—optionally—phase portrait).
