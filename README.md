# nengo-sctn_integration
 for now , since we dont want to break nengo conventions , the summation of the spikes multiplied by the weights would be taken care of by the nengo.connection class and inputed into the neuron as the current "J"  ( though we would carefully need to choose and define its parameters to correspond with the SCTN  algorithm.
 the actually mathematical computation that would be preformed by the " neuron " itself would be the decay ( the synapsic behavior  , thereforce synpase=none in connection )  the  change of the membrane voltage ( voltage in nengos syntax )  ,  the rng  module, the spike decision , and perhaps the voltage reset if the atribute is true  )
